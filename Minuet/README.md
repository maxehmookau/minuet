minuet
======

Minuet is the beginning of a project to describe musical concepts as programmable objects.

Aims
----

Initially, minuet will model notes and generate major and minor scales.

Ultimately, I hope to model:

* Chords (as a collection of notes)
* Modal scales
* Non 12-note equal temprement scales
etc...
